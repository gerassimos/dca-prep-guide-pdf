Listing Repositories:
Images are stored in collections, known as a repository, which is keyed by a name, as seen throughout the API specification. A registry instance may contain several repositories. The list of available repositories is made available through the catalog.
The catalog for a given registry can be retrieved with the following request:
GET /v2/_catalog
The response will be in the following format:
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "repositories": [
    <name>,
    ...
  ]
}

Example
https://gdn-artifactory.rd.advaoptical.com:9443/v2/_catalog

{
  "repositories" : [ "fsp_nm_centos7-vnc", "gnss-collector", "gnss-data-access", "gnss-machine-learning" ]
}
