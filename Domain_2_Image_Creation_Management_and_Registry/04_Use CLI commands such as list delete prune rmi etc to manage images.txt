Domain 2 Image Creation Management and Registry
04 - Use CLI commands such as list delete prune rmi etc to manage images

Since Docker introduced an image namespace for the CLI there are different ways of triggering the same action. 
For instance you can delete an image with 

docker rmi 
or 
docker image rm. 

On top of that there also command aliases for "docker image rm" like "rmi", "remove". 
Currently it is not clear if it is expected to know all these variants for the certification.
