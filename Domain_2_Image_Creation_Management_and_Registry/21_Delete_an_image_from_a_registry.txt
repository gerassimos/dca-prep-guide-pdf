2)Deleting an Image in a private registry
Deleting an Image
An image may be deleted from the registry via its name and reference. A delete may be issued with the following request format:

DELETE /v2/<name>/manifests/<reference>

For deletes, reference must be a digest or the delete will fail. If the image exists and has been successfully deleted, the following response will be issued:

202 Accepted
Content-Length: None

If the image had already been deleted or did not exist, a 404 Not Found response will be issued instead.

    Note When deleting a manifest from a registry version 2.3 or later, the following header must be used when HEAD or GET-ing the manifest to obtain the correct digest to delete:

Accept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json
